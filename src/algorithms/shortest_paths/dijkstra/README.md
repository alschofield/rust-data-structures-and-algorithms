# Dijkstra

Single-source shortest paths on a weighted graph with non-negative edge
weights, driven by a min-priority queue over tentative distances.

## How It Works

BFS grown up to handle weighted edges: the ripple expands by total path cost
instead of hop count. Every vertex carries a tentative best-known distance
(infinity at the start). Repeatedly extract the cheapest unsettled vertex —
this is why the min-priority queue exists — and settle it: no cheaper route
to it can exist, because any alternative would have to pass through something
already more expensive. That settlement argument is exactly what negative
edge weights break, which is why they must be rejected.

Settling a vertex relaxes its edges: for each neighbor, if going through the
settled vertex beats the neighbor's current best, update the distance and
record the settled vertex as its parent. The parent links reconstruct the
actual shortest path once the goal settles.

## Required API

```rust
pub struct DijkstraResult {
    pub distances: Vec<Option<u64>>,
    pub parents: Vec<Option<usize>>,
}

pub fn dijkstra(graph: &WeightedGraph, source: usize) -> Option<DijkstraResult>;
```

`WeightedGraph` is the non-negative-weight digraph this module
defines alongside the algorithm. Unreachable vertexes report `None`;
parent-tracking variants extend the same shape.

## Contract

- Precondition: all edge weights are non-negative. Negative weights break the
  greedy settlement argument and must be rejected, not silently mis-answered.
- A vertex's distance is final when it is extracted from the priority queue;
  it is never revisited afterward.
- Relaxation: for edge (u, v, w), if `dist[u] + w < dist[v]`, update `dist[v]`
  and the parent link. With a binary heap, decrease-key or lazy insertion with
  stale-entry skipping is acceptable; stale entries must be detectably skipped.
- Unreachable vertices report `None` for distance, never a garbage value.
- Parent links must reconstruct an actual shortest path from the source.
- Correct on graphs with cycles, parallel edges, and self-loops; an invalid
  source vertex yields `None` rather than panicking.
- Implement the priority queue behavior yourself (min-heap ordering via
  `Reverse` or a custom `Ord`), consistent with the curriculum's
  no-library-shortcut rule.

## Complexity Targets

- Time: O((V + E) log V) with a binary heap
- Space: O(V) for distances, parents, and the heap
