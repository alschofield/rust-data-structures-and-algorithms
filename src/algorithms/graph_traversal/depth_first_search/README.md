# Depth-First Search

Graph traversal that explores as far as possible along each branch before
backtracking, using recursion or an explicit stack.

## How It Works

Charge down one path as far as it goes; back up only at dead ends and try
the next branch — maze-running with a hand on the wall. The stack (explicit,
or the call stack via recursion) creates that order, and the visited set is
what terminates loops on cyclic graphs. Swap DFS's stack for a queue and it
becomes BFS; the frontier discipline is the entire difference between them.
DFS's finish ordering — a vertex finishes only after everything reachable
through it finishes — is the foundation topological sort and cycle detection
build on.

## Required API

```rust
pub fn depth_first_search(
    graph: &AdjacencyList,
    source: usize,
) -> Option<Vec<usize>>;
```

`AdjacencyList` is the graph from
`data_structures/graphs/representations/adjacency_list`.
Discovery/finish-time variants extend the same shape.

## Contract

- Visits every vertex reachable from the source exactly once; a visited set
  is mandatory to terminate on cyclic graphs.
- Both the recursive and explicit-stack forms must be understood; recursion
  depth is O(V) worst case, so deep graphs favor the explicit stack.
- Discovery/finish ordering must be consistent with DFS semantics: a vertex
  finishes only after all vertices reachable through its unvisited neighbors
  finish. This ordering is what topological sort and cycle detection build on.
- Correct on cyclic graphs, self-loops, and disconnected graphs; an invalid
  source vertex yields `None` rather than panicking.
- The graph is borrowed immutably and never modified during traversal.

## Complexity Targets

- Time: O(V + E) with an adjacency list
- Space: O(V) for the visited set plus recursion/stack depth up to O(V)
